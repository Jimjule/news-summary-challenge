# Plan

I will be building a single-page web app that:
 - Shows all of the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API
 - Clicking a headline shows a summary of that article




# User Stories

beforeEach('As a busy politician');

  I can see all of today's headlines in one place
  So I know what the big stories of the day are

  I can click a link to see the original news article
  So that I can get an in depth understanding of a very important story

  I can see a summary of a news article
  So I can get a few more details about an important story

  I can see a picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines
  So that I have something nice to look at

  I can read the site comfortably on my phone
  Just in case my laptop breaks

  I can see whizzy animations in the app
  To make my news reading more fun
